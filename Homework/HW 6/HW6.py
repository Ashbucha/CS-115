Q1 - Explain what is the largest number of bits that your compress algorithm could
possibly use to encode a 64-bit string/image.
Q1 Answer - There is no limit. The compress algorithm in this code should be able to encode any 64-bit string or image.

Q2 - Describe the tests that you conducted and the compression ratios that you found.
Q2 Answer - I tested a few imagines I thought up, and found that the longer the compressed string is, the greater the compression value becomes.

Q3 - Argue to NASA that Professor Lai is Lai-ingâ€”such an algorithm cannot exist!
Q3 Answer - Since his function always will return a shorter string than the one inputted, he looses data everytime he compresses a string.
